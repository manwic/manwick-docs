# Project Description
The 2D Tactical Team Shooter is a fast-paced multiplayer game that emphasizes team coordination, tactical movement, and strategic combat. Unlike traditional shooters that prioritize raw reflexes, this game focuses on cooperative gameplay, where players take on different roles and use weapons, gadgets, and abilities to secure victory.

Players compete in teams across objective-based maps (Capture the Flag, Secure Zone, Elimination) with a top-down 2D perspective. The project is built using a modern 2D game engine and supports real-time multiplayer networking, customizable loadouts, and tactical gadgets.

### ‚úÖ **Best Points for Usage Example ‚Äì 2D Shooter Game**

---

#### üîπ **1. Starting the Game**
