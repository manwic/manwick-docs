# Project Description
The 2D Tactical Team Shooter is a fast-paced multiplayer game that emphasizes team coordination, tactical movement, and strategic combat. Unlike traditional shooters that prioritize raw reflexes, this game focuses on cooperative gameplay, where players take on different roles and use weapons, gadgets, and abilities to secure victory.

Players compete in teams across objective-based maps (Capture the Flag, Secure Zone, Elimination) with a top-down 2D perspective. The project is built using a modern 2D game engine and supports real-time multiplayer networking, customizable loadouts, and tactical gadgets.

- [Build Instructions](Development/BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - How to build the Sure! Here's a refined list of the **best usage example points** for a 2D tactical shooter game (like the one you described), focusing on **clarity**, **structure**, and **real-world relevance** for players and testers:

---

### ✅ **Best Points for Usage Example – 2D Shooter Game**

---

#### 🔹 **1. Starting the Game**

* **Host a Game (Server Mode):**

  ```bash
  ./tactical-shooter.exe --host
  ```

  > Starts a local server allowing other players to connect to your machine.

* **Join a Game (Client Mode):**

  ```bash
  ./tactical-shooter.exe --connect 192.168.1.100
  ```

  > Connects to a host machine (replace with actual IP of host).

---

#### 🔹 **2. Match Setup Flow**

1. **Player A** hosts the match.
2. **Players B, C, etc.** join using the host’s IP.
3. Game auto-assigns players to **Red** or **Blue** team.
4. Each player selects a **loadout**:

   * Rifleman (assault-focused)
   * Sniper (long-range)
   * Medic (support & healing)

---

#### 🔹 **3. Gameplay Objectives**

* Red Team: **Defend** the base.
* Blue Team: **Attack** to capture the flag.
* First team to win **3 rounds** wins the match.

---

#### 🔹 **4. Core Controls**

| Action      | Key/Button |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Move        | `W A S D`  |
| Aim & Shoot | `Mouse`    |
| Reload      | `R`        |
| Use Gadget  | `Q / E`    |
| Scoreboard  | `Tab`      |
| Pause/Menu  | `Esc`      |

---

#### 🔹 **5. Quick Gameplay Tips**

* **Use cover** to avoid incoming fire.
* **Coordinate** with your team using roles (e.g. sniper covers, medic supports).
* **Flank** the enemy to break defensive lines.
* **Watch reload timing** – don’t reload in open ground.

---

#### 🔹 **6. Example Scenario**

> **You** host the match.
> **Your friends** join your IP.
> You play as a **Medic on Red Team**, defending base with gadgets.
> A teammate (Sniper) covers the flag.
> You win 3 rounds by defending successfully – **Victory!**
